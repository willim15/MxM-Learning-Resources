 Data Visualization Notes
==========================

The goals of a visualization can vary:
	exploration and understanding
	presentation and explanation
	engagement

Four terms are in common use:
	statistical graphics;
	data visualization;
	information visualization;
	infographics.
Some view these as interchangeable; others view them as a continuum.

Visualizations can be static, possibly printed on paper; dynamic, involving animation or interactive features.

data-driven project typically involves several cycles of

importing, cleaning, and arranging the data
exploring and understanding the data
modeling the data to separate signal from noise
exploring residuals and other aspects model/data mismatch
possibly getting additional data
Visualization can help at each stage an is often crucial for

understanding the nature of the original data;
understanding a complex fitted model;
understanding departures from the model.

==========================
 	R Visualization
==========================

R has several flexible static graphics system, including
base graphics, or standard graphics, provided by the graphics package in the base R distribution
trellis graphics, or lattice graphics, provided by the lattice package (one of the standard Recommended packages typically bundled with R)

ggplot2 based on Wilkinsonâ€™s Grammar of Graphics and available from CRAN.

Some interactive exploratory graphics packages include

ggobi for exploring point clouts in higher dimensions
rgl for for 3D rendering and viewing iplots, a Java-based dynamic graphics system for linked plots

Static graphics output is produced by a device. These can be screen devices, like Windows, Quartz, X11 file devices, like pdf or png

Devices are used through a device-independent layer implemented in the grDevices package.
Base graphics is implemented directly using this layer. lattice and ggplot2 are built on an intermediate framework known as grid graphics and implemented in the grid package.
Using grid features is occasionally useful for arranging multiple lattice or ggplot2 plots on a page.

Some Task Levels for Visualization
In evaluating visualization methods it can be useful to think about several levels of tasks that might be accomplished with a visualiation. A useful list, from highest to lowest level:

Analyze: Identify patterns, distributions, presence of outliers or clusters, other interesting features.

Search: Look up aspects of a feature known in advance or revealed by the visualiation.

Query: Identify, compare features of individual items.

Each higher level builds on the levels below.

As we look at different methods it is useful to consider the tasks they are suited for,

 	  Scalability
==========================

Data sets come in many different sizes and shapes.
Some techniques work well for smaller data sets but deteriorate in effectiveness as size increases.
Sometimes modifications are available that slow the deterioration.
Other methods scale better, though usually at the expense of giving up some level of detail.
As we look at different methods it is useful to consi
